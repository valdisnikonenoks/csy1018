              <b>Skills and Professional Experience related to my field of study: </b>
  </p>
<p>


          My uncle was a programmer and I used to visit him very often to use his computer, he used to have multiple operating systems on it, so at very young age I already learned how to navigate around Linux and Windows.
          He was one of the first people who teached me how to fix broken drivers and other little things like that.

          My personal experience isn't that big. My whole skillset is self thought from online tutorials.
          I used to help manage my fathers companies website and I also did the translation for it from latvian to english.
          My intrest in webpages started at age 15, when I was very into gaming and me and a couple of my friends started to build our teams website
          I hosted the server that webpage was on and I hosted game server aswell. By building website I learned a lot about html and how actually flexible it is.
