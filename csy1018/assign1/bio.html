      I'm 20 year old student studying Business Computing in University of Northampton. I'm man of many hobbies. In my spare time I play basketball, ride my skateboard, write music or watch tv shows.
      I also like to play around in Photoshop or Sony Vegas.
      I found my passion for computing when I was a kid, I used to fix my family member computers by searching tutorials online and fixing them  step by step and somehow I got into computers.
      You should know that I always try to give 100% and I try to never back down from challange!

      It's my first year of studies, but I feel that I'm going to be good at Web development and Problem solving(Programming).
      I like to study computing and I can't wait for next semester.
